# Team Contract
## Team Members

- Kevin-Christopher Laskai
- Rea Koehler
- Liam Kopke

## Strength & Weaknesses

_Within the context of this project, what are the strengths and weaknesses that each member brings to the team?_

- Kevin-Chris: Very bad at MAUI and XAML in general, strong in python, ReTerminal, etc.
- Liam: Good at frontend, XAML, kind of weak in binding principles in maui.
- Rea: Good at backend, server code, frontend polish, learning new services. Weak at initial UI design, wireframing, clean xaml.

## Definition of "good enough" for this project

Good enough means meeting the requirements on paper we do not need to go above and beyond.

## Division of work

_How will each member contribute to the project?_

At the start of a milestone we will decide who works on what in a short standup, but generally we will divide the work as such:

- Rea: Design of the software class setups, most azure implementations and setup. Pure backend stuff when around. Continuous integration.
- Liam: UI Design, base XML implementation, hardware setup for reterminal and base classes to communicate
- Chris: Most reterminal code, tie in views with models (UI Implementation), wireframe designs,

Note: Despite this, we will all end up working on everything in due time.

## Frequency of communication

_How often will the team be in touch and what tools will be used to communicate?_

We will have short 15-30 minute calls every Monday and Thursday, adapting as needed according to our schedules.

## Response delays

_What is a reasonable delay to reply to messages? Is it the same for weekdays and weekends?_

Primary communication will be over a discord channel, expected response is a few hours on weekdays, and a day on weekends.

## Receiving feedback

_How do you prefer to receive feedback? Each member must provide a sample sentence for how they would like to receive constructive feedback from their peers._

_(If unsure, assume a hypothetical situation such as you have not completed your work in time or you have not replied to a message in a timely manner)._

- All: Just tell me the issue point blank, no need to hold back.

## In case of conflict

_If a team member fails to communicate as described in this contract or does not respond to constructive feedback, what measures should the other teammate take?_

Stage an "intervention", all get into a call, see what went wrong, assess what we can do going forward. If there is no mutual solution found that is realistic, we discuss further with teachers.
